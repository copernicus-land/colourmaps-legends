# CGLS 10-daily global 300m evapotranspiration (ETA) colourmap and Legends
For easy M2M integration, each variable has its own colourmap and legend. The water fluxes share an identical colourmap and legend, as do the standard deviation variables.
1. **Water flux**: The water flux colour map is identical for the following 9 variables:
    - *ET-TSEBPT*
    - *ET-ETLOOK*
    - *ET-ENSEMBLE*
    - *E-TSEBPT*
    - *E-ETLOOK*
    - *E-ENSEMBLE*
    - *T-TSEBPT*
    - *T-ETLOOK*
    - *T-ENSEMBLE*
2. **Standard deviation**: The standard deviation colour map is identical for the following 3 variables:
    - *ET-STD*
    - *E-STD*
    - *T-STD*
