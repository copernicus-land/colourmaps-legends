  "collectionDescription": "The Wet / Dry Snow (WDS) product provides information on the snow state (wet or dry) by combining Sentinel-1 radar-based wet snow maps within the snow cover extent derived from Sentinel-2 optical data. It is generated in near real-time at European scale, with a spatial resolution of 60 m x 60 m in areas where Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 observation tracks overlap. It is available for the period from 2016 to the present. More information here.",

The dataset has also the following classes: radar shadow, layover, foreshortening (200), shadow, and clouds and cloud shadow (205) from the aggregated FSCTOC layer, water (210), forest (220), urban areas (230), and no data (255).",
