  "collectionDescription": "Provides information about the net amount of biomass, or carbon, produced by plants per unit area and time, expressed in gC/m²/day. It is equal to the difference between the Gross Primary Production (GPP), i.e. the total amount of carbon produced through photosynthesis, and the amount of energy used for plant respiration. Every 10-days, estimates are available at global scale, at a spatial resolution of ~ 300 m, from January 2014 to the present. More information here",
