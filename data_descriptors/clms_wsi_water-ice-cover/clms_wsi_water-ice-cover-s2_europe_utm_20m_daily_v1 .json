  "collectionDescription": "The Water and Ice Cover by Sentinel-2 (WICS2) product provides the water and ice extent over land. A water mask is used to differentiate between snow on ice-covered water areas and snow on land. It is generated in near real-time at European scale based on optical satellite data from the Sentinel-2 constellation, with a spatial resolution of 20 m x 20 m. It is available for the period from 2016 to the present. More information here.",

The dataset has also the following classes for areas where water/ice classification cannot be determined from Sentinel-2 optical imagery: cloud or cloud shadow (205), and no data (255).",
