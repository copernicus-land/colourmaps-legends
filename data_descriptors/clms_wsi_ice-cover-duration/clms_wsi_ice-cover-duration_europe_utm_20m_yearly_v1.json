  "collectionDescription": "The Ice Cover Duration (ICD) product describes how long inland waters are covered by ice. For each pixel and for a given hydrological year, it provides the number of days with ice cover. The hydrological year starts on 1 September. The product is generated at the European scale with a spatial resolution of 20 m × 20 m. It is based on ice cover maps derived from Sentinel-2 optical data (Water/Ice Cover WIC S2) and Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar data (Water/Ice Cover WIC S1). It is available for the period from 2016 to the present and can be downloaded in multiple projections and pixel spacings. More information here.",
