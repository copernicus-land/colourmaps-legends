  "collectionDescription": "The High Resolution Water Layer (HRWL) product provides classified maps showing permanent water, temporary water, dry areas, and sea water. It is a multi-annual product, typically covering a 7-year period, and is updated every 3 years. The product is generated at the European scale with a spatial resolution of 10 m × 10 m. It is based on the annual Water Cover Duration (WCD) production, which combines water masks from Sentinel-1 radar and Sentinel-2 optical imagery with Water/Ice Cover data from Sentinel-2 (WIC S2). HRWL is available for the reference years 2021 and 2024 and can be downloaded in multiple projections and pixel spacings. More information here.",
